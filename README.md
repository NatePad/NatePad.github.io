# NatePad.github.io

This is a personal portfolio site that consists of front end web files. The live version of this app is hosted by GitHub Pages at [natepad.github.io](https://natepad.github.io/).

Just for fun, I included a random background generator that chooses a random image from assets/images/background when either the index.html or the portfolio.html page is loaded.
